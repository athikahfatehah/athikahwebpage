	<h6>One week has past. Today is week 6. I've been wondering when will the goverment will allow us to go out. Today topic is about if else, for loop and while loop. Madam Siti has uploaded the video in the youtube to taught us how to do the coding. I'm really thankful for that because I'm a type of person that need to see with my eyes to understand it fully. So, Madam if you are reading this, thank you so much! <3</h6>
