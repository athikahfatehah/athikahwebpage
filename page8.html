	<h6>This is the last week of I doing this pages. Final thought about this subject is, it is a very interesting subject to learnt. We must keep doing the exercise unless we will be totally lost. It also a subject that will show our creativity  by creating webpages. So, next page is going to have form to comments about my pages that I created. Please be sure to fill in the form okay? So, this week I learnt about form enhancement and Javascript validation which I will include the videos below for more understanding <3</h6>
