<h6>Hai! I know that I started this page with Week 4 but it is because I been so caught up with my works that I only have time too write this by Week 4. So, I will compiling all the works that I have learnt from Week 1 until Week 4 in this page. So, this is my first time to learn about Web Development. To be honest, i felt scared and also excited to learn about this subject. I know it might be challenging but it not hurt to try right? So, the first things that Madam Siti taught was introduction to html. We were told that we need to use Sublime Software to write the html because it has everything in it. We taught about color, font and how to add images. By the time we almost finish with our lesson, Madam Siti taught how to create our own localhost using Xammpp. I think it was easy. At least for now. <3</h6>
