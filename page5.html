	<h6>Week 5, being at home while working totally does not suit me that well. I'm struggling to manage my time so that I'm not stressing out. For this week, I leart about Javascript which I will put down below links that Madam Siti give to us. At first I thought that Java and Javasript is the same thing but its not. I had learnt introduction to Javascript, how to do the coding and also the differences between Javascript and html. <3</h6>
